# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the bin/rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).

# Examples:

  restaurants = Restaurant.create([{ name: "Polissons", address: "rue ramey", category: "french" }, { name: "Manifattura", address: "blvd raspail", category: "italian" }, {name: "Foujita", address: "st michel", category: "japanese"}, {name: "A cote", address: "rue de clignancourt", category: "french"}, {name: "Blabla", address: "rue sarrette", category: "belgian"}])
